Here we describe the user manual of the algorithm
strHunter is the name of the executable file.
The syntax to run the file is 

$strHuntre Inputfile.txt [options] > Output.txt
Following are the options currently available.
********************************************************************************************************************

-n specify the minimum motif length
STRHunter -n 4 -m 6 Seq.fna will Report all the STRs with motif of lengths between 4 to 6
-m specify the maximum motif length
STRHunter -n 4 -m 4 Seq.fna will Report all the STRs only with motif of length 4
-l specify the minimum cutoff length
STRHunter -n 4 -m 4 -l 12 Seq.fna will Report all the STRs only with motif length 4 and minimum length of STR region is 12nt
-p specify the whether to consider partial motif or not
STRHunter -l 350 -p 1 Seq.fna will Report all the STRs with motif length between 1 to 6, minimum length of STR region is 350nt and partial motifs will be considered
-u specify the length of upstream ﬂanking DNA
STRHunter -l 350 -u 20 Seq.fna will Report all the STRs with motif length between 1 to 6, minimum length of STR region is 350nt and upstream ﬂanking DNA sequences of length 20nt will also be reported
-w specify the length of downstream ﬂanking DNA
STRHunter -l 350 -w 20 Seq.fna will Report all the STRs with motif length between 1 to 6, minimum length of STR region is 350nt and downstream ﬂanking DNA sequences of length 20nt will also be reported
-a
will set the ﬁlter to report STR of either atomic or non-atomic motifs
STRHunter -l 12 -a 0 Seq.fna will report the STRs with non-atomic motifs too, hence all atomicity ﬁltering will be disabled
